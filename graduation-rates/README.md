##Notes from David
Andrew and I started working on this back in December 2014. It was kind of a winter break project for me and didn't last long. Work fell off when time off ended after New Years.

I've done all of the coding so that should explain the state of it. I figure at the very least I turned the PDF into a workable CSV. 

Generate-graph uses d3.js, and as far as I can remember is original. Dynamic-table just runs the CSV I made through some JS table generator code I found, and then fails to go on to generate a graph.
